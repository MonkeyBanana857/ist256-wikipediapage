        <p><strong> Alexander Cullen</strong> is a guy who goes to <a href = "https://berks.psu.edu/" target="_blank"> Penn State Berks.</a> He is currently taking a
            web design class called IST 256 taught by Professor Yoder. When the professor bore witness
            to this beautiful wikipedia page, he was overwhelmed with joy and gave Alex a 100% A+ that he would keep throughout the rest of the semester.</p>
        <h2 style = "border-bottom: 1px solid black; padding-bottom: 5px;">Early life</h2>
            <p>Alex was born in <a href = "https://monkeyworld.org/" target="_blank"> Monkey World.</a> He's having trouble of thinking about what to write in this assignment,
            and doesn't want to put his actual personal information because that would be weird so
            he figures the professor will be fine with him just writing whatever as long as
            he can demonstrate he knows how to make a Wikipedia page for himself. </p>
        <h2 style = "border-bottom: 1px solid black; padding-bottom: 5px;">Controversy</h2>
        <p>Alex has had a few run-ins with the law during his life. Once, he broke into the Pentagon
        on a dare and spent an entire week hiding in a photocopier before a security guard found him
        and shot him to death. He spent four years in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp" target="_blank"> Guantanamo Bay</a> for that little stunt.</p>
